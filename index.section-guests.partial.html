                    I attended TechCon last year and I was extremely impressed. Not only were the sessions incredibly
                    informative, but the speakers were passionate and knowledgeable about their topics.

                    I'm a TechCon fan. I like what their speakers have to offer. I've been attending the conference for
                    two years in a row, and I feel that it has helped me grow my business and evolve.

                    The venue was set up in a way that allowed for networking amongst attendees and vendors. As a CTO, I
                    was able to learn and network with some of the brightest minds in the industry.
